# Variables

Variables are named storage for RPL values.

## Store

Store an object into a specified location. For example `2 'ABC' STO` stores the value `2` in a global variable named `ABC`.

`Value` `Name` ▶

The `Value` is copied in a storage location identified by `Name`. The storage location depends on the type of `Name`, which can be quoted in an expression:

* Symbol or integer: The value is stored in a global variable with that name in the current directory, which is created if necessary. Whether integers can be used as variable names depends on the `NumberedVariables` setting.

* Local name: The value is stored in the corresponding local variable.

* Setting name: The value is used for the corresponding setting, as if the setting command had been executed. For example, `16 'Base' STO` has the same effect as `16 Base`.

* Text: `Value` is stored in a named file on the [flash storage](#flash-storage).


## Recall
Recall an object from a specified location. For example `'ABC' RCL` recalls the value from a global variable named `ABC`.

`Name` ▶ `Value`

The `Value` is fetched from a storage location identified by `Name`. The storage location depends on the type of `Name`, which can be quoted in an expression:

* Symbol or integer: The value is fetched from a global variable with that name in the current directory or any enclosing directory. Whether integers can be used as variable names depends on the `NumberedVariables` setting.

* Local name: The value is fetched from the corresponding local variable.

* Setting name: The value is fetched from the corresponding setting. For example, `'Base' RCL` returns the current value as set by `Base`.

* Text: `Value` is fetched from a named file on the [flash storage](#flash-storage)


## Flash storage

SwissMicros calculators have built-in flash storage, that can act as a USB disk when the calculator is connected to a computer. DB48X can read and write to this flash storage using the regular `STO` and `RCL` commands, simply by giving a text containing the file name as the `Name` argument of these commands.

The format of the file depends on how the name ends:

* `.txt`: the value is stored as text.

* `.48s`: the value is stored as source code in text format. This differs from `.txt` files for text objects, which will be quoted.

* `.48b`: the value is stored in version-specific binary format. This format is only guaranteed to be readable by the same firmware version that wrote it, but it is more compact, faster and energy efficient than the source format.

* `.csv`: The value is stored in comma-separated values format. This is mostly interesting for arrays and lists, which can be echanged with spreadsheets and other PC applications that can input or output CSV files.


## STO+
Add a value to the content of a variable


## STO-
Subtract a value from the contents of a variable


## STO×
Multiply the contents of a variable by a value


## STO÷
Divide the contents of a variable by a value


## RCL+
Add the content of a variable to a value on the stack


## RCL-
Subtract the contents of a variable from a value on a stack


## RCL×
Multiply a value on the stack by the contents of a variable


## RCL÷
Divide a value on the stack by the contents of a variable


## Increment
Add one to the content of a variable


## Decrement
Subtract one from content of a variable


## Purge

Delete a global variable from the current directory

*Remark*: `Purge` only removes a variable from the current directory, not the
enclosing directories. Since [Recall](#Recall) will fetch variable values from
enclosing directories, it is possible that `'X' Purge 'X' Recall` will fetch a
value for `X` from an enclosing directory. Use [PurgeAll](#PurgeAll) if you want
to purge a variable including in enclosing directories.

## PurgeAll

Delete a global variable from the current directory and enclosing directories.

*Remark*: If a variable with the same name exists in multiple enclosing
directories, `PurgeAll` may purge multiple variables. Use [Purge](#Purge) if you
want to only purge a variable in the current directory.


## CreateDirectory
Create new directory


## PurgeDirectory
Purge entire directory tree


## UpDirectory
Change current directory to its parent


## HomeDirectory
Change current directory to HOME


## DirectoryPath
Get a path to the current directory


## Variables

List all visible variables in a directory

▶ `{ Variables... }`


## TypedVariables

List variables of a specific type

`type` ▶ `{ Variables... }`
`{ types... }` ▶ `{ Variables... }`

See the [`Type`](#type) command for a list of types.

## Copy

Copy a value into a global variable. This is primarily intended for use in
algebraic notations, although it also works in RPL. The HP50G Advanced Reference
Manual refers to this command as _▶ (Store)_.

```
'(2+5)▶X'
42 'A' ▶ 1 +
```

The command returns the stored object on the stack. The returned copy is a
direct reference to the stored global object and does not consume additional
memory.


## ORDER
Sort variables in a directory


## QUOTEID
Add single quotes to a variable name


## UNQUOTEID
Remove single quotes from a variable name


## HIDEVAR
Hide a variable (make invisible)


## UNHIDEVAR

## CLVAR

## LOCKVAR
Make variable read-only


## UNLOCKVAR
Make variable read/write


## RENAME
Change the name of a variable



## SPROP
Store a property to a variable


## RPROP

## PACKDIR
Pack a directory in an editable object
